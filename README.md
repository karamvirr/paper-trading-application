Hello and welcome!

I developed this stock market simulator app as a platform for simulated trading. It uses real-time stock prices via a [third-party API](https://iexcloud.io/), allowing you to buy and sell stocks without risking actual money. Built using Java, this project was an excellent opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge of Android development and practice designing robust, maintainable software.

Please note that the code available in this repository is at version 1.1.3 and might be outdated by the time you view it. The repository includes only the Java, XML, and PNG files that are essential to the project. Other components, such as API endpoints, the app manifest, and Google Admob unit IDs, are not included in this public repository.

You can find this application on Google Play and it is compatible with Android devices. Click [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketprofit) to download and start exploring the functionality of the app. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
