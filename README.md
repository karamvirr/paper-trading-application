Hello and welcome! 

I built this paper trading application as a way for me to buy/sell stocks with real time prices (leveraging a 3rd party API) all without risking any real money.

Building this application taught me alot about Android development. Additionally, it served as practice of designing and constructing reliable and maintainable software. 

This application is available on Google Play and can be installed on Android devices, click [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pocketprofit) to download. Enjoy playing around with this app as much as I enjoyed building it!
